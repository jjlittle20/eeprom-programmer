<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

I found that Ben Eater's EEPROM programmer project wasn't exactly what I needed so I created a way to stream the data from a .bin file over Serial with Python. Originally this was all done through the CLI but I quickly realised it would be nice to have some clickable buttons and the data displayed nicely on screen.

### Built With

- Python
- Javascript
- Arduino IDE (C++)
- BootStrap 5

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

To convert files from assembly to a .bin file for your cpu you will need a package such as sjasmplus which is for z80 archetecture. You will also need an arduino - this will work on an arduino nano with the smaller 168 ic. I am using and arduino UNO for my project. The Arduino sketch is currently hardcoded for 2048 memory addresses.

### Prerequisites

If you dont have an assembler we will use sjasmplus for the z80.

- download latest release at https://github.com/z00m128/sjasmplus/releases

Next you will need to unzip the file - somewhere permanent - and add the PATH i.e `/user/documents/sjasmplus` to the path environment variable in Windows System Properties. Make sure to edit the system variables and not the user variables.

You may need to restart your machine for it to work.

Open a command prompt and type `sjasmplus` you should see a help prompt which means it is setup correctly.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/jjlittle20/eeprom-programmer.git
   ```
2. Upload the sketch to your arduino

3. Enter your .bin file location and COM port number in `config/settings.json`
4. run the `index.py` file

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

1. Press READ button the read the contents of your connected EEPROM.
2. Press WRITE to write the contents of the .bin file configured in settings.json.
3. Press ERASE to erase the EEPROM

<!-- ROADMAP -->

## Roadmap

- [ ] Create a pcb for this design in an arduino HAT format
- [ ] 'POKE' command to change a specific memory address
- [ ] Ability to configure settings from UI
- [ ] Ability to set EEPROM size
  - [ ] Create a generic pin setting system to accept any EEPROM pinout

See the [open issues](https://github.com/jjlittle20/eeprom-programmer/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).
